 The Stay_Alive tool was created for full-time professionals working in an office environment. 
 The tool is very simple but offers many practical solutions to the average working wo/man. 
 
 Once, downloaded or installed on the Desktop as a .ps1 (PowerShell) exexcutable, simply double-click
 the icon to run the program. It will 'click' the numlock key every 6 seconds to keep your computer/display
 from going to sleep.
 
 If you are a contractor using 2 machines, annoyed of your computer sleeping everytime you go to the bathroom, 
 or just need to appear 'online' at all times; this tool is perfect for you.
 
 Installation:
 Command line:
 1. git clone https://github.com/rpanov/Stay_Alive.git
 2. save file to Desktop
 3. Double click to run
 Manual:   
 1. control+c Stay_Alive.ps1 code to notepad
 2. Save notepad file as .ps1 executable to Desktop
 3. Double click and run program
 Note: many corporations block users from downloading PowerShell scripts from the internet (for good reasons)
 and therefor, you need to copy and paste the code in to a file of your own creation as a work-around.
 
 Please feel free so give advice, ideas, and opinions on how it can be improved!

Thanks,

Stay Alive
